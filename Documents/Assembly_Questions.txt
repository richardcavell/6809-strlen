1.  What is the value $FFFF in decimal?

2.  In assembly, what does the instruction BEQ actually test for?

3.  What does the instruction LEAX 1,X do to the value of X?

4.  Why is it necessary to have a label such as _strlen_loop amongst the
    assembly language instructions?

5.  Why do we perform PULS X,PC as one operation rather than two?

6.  Why do we test for the terminating zero using LDA ,X instead of TST ,X ?

7.  Why do we use the value $FFFF to indicate an error instead of, say,
    returning the value 0 ?

8.  Why do we use a 16 bit register to store the length of the string
    instead of an 8 bit register?

9.  Why do we use BRA instead of JMP ?

10. If an interrupt occurs during execution of the inner loop of one of the
    main routines, and the interrupt handler saves registers on the System
    stack, will that corrupt the values saved by our routines?

Bonus Question:

11. What is the value of creating and exporting a symbol such as
    _no_error_strlen_start, when it could be kept track of within the mind
    of the programmer?
