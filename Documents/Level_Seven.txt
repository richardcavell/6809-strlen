1.  Remove the SUBD #1 in nestrlen.s
    (This produces what is called an off-by-one error)

2.  Change the BNE in nestrlen.s to a BRA
    (This produces what is called an infinite loop)

3.  Add a clear-screen routine to helper1 and use this instead of CLS to
    clear the screen in TEST.BAS.

4.  Translate the test suite into your favourite language, and remove
    unwanted languages.

5.  Demonstrate that the BASIC portion of the project will crash if the
    string is placed in an unsuitable portion of the memory map.

I hope that you enjoy even more programming!
