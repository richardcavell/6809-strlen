I hope that you enjoy even more programming!

1.  Make TEST.BAS issue progress reports while writing the string to memory.

2.  Use SWI (software interrupt) to call the string-length routines.  You
    will need to install a SWI handler.

3.  Modify strlen.s and no_error_strlen.s so that if the string is
    "SECRET PASSWORD" the computer will crash.

4.  Modify the test suite so that it loads the machine language routines
    from tape.

5.  Look at instruction timings for each of the instructions in the machine
    language routines - is it possible to save time anywhere?
