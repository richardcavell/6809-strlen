Part of 6809-strlen by Richard Cavell (c) 2017, 2018, 2019, 2025

Once you have begun to really understand the basics of the project,
try these exercises:

1.  In most 6809-based systems, the IRQ vectors are placed in locations
    $FFFx, so it is difficult or impossible to store a string in those
    locations.  Adjust strlen.s so that it returns "no end" before it gets
    to the IRQ vectors.

2.  Have strlen delete characters as it reads them, for security purposes.

3.  Modify the BASIC program so that when it is counting the string's
    length manually, there is a visual indication of activity.

4.  Modify strlen and nestrlen so that they give the same visual indicator
    of activity.

5.  Change strlen to require TWO zeroes to end the string.

I hope that you enjoy learning even more!
