1.  Modify the test suite to profile the assembly portion (ie time how long
    it takes) and print a comparison between the BASIC and assembly method,
    in terms of their speed.

    Note that the version of BASIC provided with the Color Computer provides
    a variable called TIMER, which increments either every one-fiftieth or
    every one-sixtieth of a second.  Write a program to test how fast
    TIMER increments on your machine.

2.  Modify strlen so that it skips over blank spaces without counting them.

3.  Use an ASCII chart or write a BASIC program, and identify which character
    codes are non-printing (ie they do not produce an identifiable glyph on
    the screen).

    Modify strlen so that it does not count these.

4.  The ASCII code for backspace is 8. Have the strlen routine correctly
    reduce, instead of increase, the length count when it encounters 
    backspace characters.

    Be careful not to let the length drop below zero.

5.  Write a routine that searches a string for a given character, and
    returns a pointer to it, or $0000 if the character does not exist in
    the string.

I hope that you enjoy more programming!
