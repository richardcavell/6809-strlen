1. What is the difference between line 11430 and line 11640 ?

2. Why are time-critical subroutines placed at the start of the program ?

3. What is the purpose of line 6900 ?

4. Why is line 12650 a GOTO instead of GOSUB : RETURN ?

5. Why aren't the very long strings for test 7 through test 10 stored in
   a BASIC string variable ?

6. What is the point of adding 0.5 in the calculation in line 5510 ?

7. What is the point of multiplying EA by 256 in line 13010 ?

8. Look at the subroutine that starts at line 10000. Is it a good thing to
   have such simple code pieces as subroutines ?

9. What is the net effect of line 6300 ?

10. Why does line 13420 compare L to -1 instead of &HFFFF ?

Bonus question:

11. The test suite does not intentionally test for the no-end condition.
    Why not?
