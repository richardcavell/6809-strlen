Part of 6809-strlen by Richard Cavell (c) 2017, 2018, 2019, 2025
https://github.com/richardcavell/6809-strlen

1.  Have the caller pass a second address, and make strlen return a
    no-end error if a string appears not to end before that address is
    reached.

2.  Write a routine that ensures that all the characters in the string
    are unique.

3.  Combine helper1 and helper2 into one helper function.

4.  Compress the memory map so that the test suite and all the routines
    are squeezed into the smallest possible space.

5.  Write an additional assembly routine that copies a string from one memory
    location to another, and call it 6809-strcpy.  Add code to the test suite
    to prove that it works with all of the strings.

I hope that you enjoy even more programming!
