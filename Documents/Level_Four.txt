1.  Modify strlen to search for the character "Q" instead of the end of
    the string.

    You will need to decide what happens if there is no "Q" in the string
    being tested.

2.  Change the calling convention for the strlen and no_error_strlen
    routines to pass the address of the string to be searched on the
    system stack.

3.  Modify strlen to change every character of the string to lowercase
    while it reads the string.

    Note that on some Color Computer machines, lowercase letters will
    appear as reversed text.

4.  Reorder the instructions so that _strlen_normal_finish immediately
    follows _strlen_loop_end, and the error handler routine is below the
    normal exit point.

    Be careful to modify the assembly instructions so that the program
    flows to the correct place in each case.

5.  Change the memory map so that the machine language routines and the
    string to be tested start at $6100 instead of $6000.

    Remember to change the test suite as well.

I hope that you enjoy programming!
